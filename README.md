# OOP Coffee Machine
This Python program simulates the operation of a coffee machine, allowing users to make various types of coffee drinks. Originally implemented as a procedural program, it was later refactored into an object-oriented version to demonstrate the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP).
Features: Allows users to select and make different types of coffee drinks, such as espresso, latte, and cappuccino. Implements a simple user interface for interacting with the coffee machine, providing a seamless user experience. Clone the repository to your local machine. Run the Python script main.py. Follow the in-line instructions to interact with the coffee machine and make your desired coffee drinks. Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different customization options. Contributions and feedback are welcome! I'm just beginning my journey and your comments are very much appreciated :)
